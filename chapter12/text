Write
a
Prolog
program
that
reads
in
a
plain
text
file
word
by
word,
and
asserts
all
read
words
and
their
frequency
into
the
Prolog
database.
You
may
use
the
predicate
readWord/2
to
read
in
words.
Use
a
dynamic
predicate
word/2
to
store
the
words,
where
the
first
argument
is
a
word,
and
the
second
argument
is
the
frequency
of
that
word.
